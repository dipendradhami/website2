                According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu
                 sage called Ne, referred to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to 
                 Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by Ne, the country in the heart of
                  the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl. According to Nepāl Mahātmya, Nemi 
                  was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati.According to 
                  Buddhist mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of 
                  serpents to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would
                   take care of the community that would settle it. As the cherished of Ne, the
                    valley would be called Nepāl.[21] According to Gopalarājvamshāvali, the 
                    genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c.1380s, Nepal is named after 
                    Nepa the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In this
                     account, the cow that issued milk to the spot, at which Nepa discovered the
                      Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon investigation, was also named Ne.
